Please set steam path in steampath.txt if it's different from the default "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\"

Also remember the extra "\\" at the end :D

You will need to restart DPS IDLE for the new crashhandler.dll to be loaded by steam. Enjoy!

You might need to run the config swapper as admin.
